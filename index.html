            Today we went over the rules and proceedures for this class, as well as the engineering process. Afterwards, we went outside to do a challenge. The class split into two groups, and each group had eight pipes and one marble. The goal was to hold the pipes in a line and get the marble to roll all the way through the pipes into a bucket placed at the end. Each person in the group had to hold a pipe once, which was challenging.

        Today we finished creating our Rube Goldberg Machine. After a lot of trial and error, we finally got it to work. The main thing we changed from our original design was the cardboard flap with the needle (right next to the balloon). Instead of doing that, we attached the needle to the car and got rid of the carboard flap. We had some trouble with the pulley at first. We attached the baseball to one end of the string, and an eraser to the other end, which worked. How our machine works is you let go of the pulley with baseball. The baseball hits the lever, making the car with the needle roll down the inclined plane and pop the balloon.

            This week our unit was on Computer Engineering, so we learned about parts of a computer. Today, we disected a computer. Mr. Kim gave us the google slides with the instructions, and we had to disassemble and reassemble it. It was difficult, but we managed to do it successfully.

            Today our assignment was to make a prosthetic hand, since our new unit is on bioengineering. We were given cardboard, duct tape, and string. Caitlin and I traced my hand but then made the fingers bigger (for better grip). We ended up taping the middle and ring finger together. We taped the string to the three big fingers. Caitlin used the rubber band to keep all the strings down, which at one point ripped off the "thumb" (that was kind of funny) but we fixed it. I don't think that the thumb really helped, although maybe it provided a little bit of support. The three strings connect to one string at the "wrist", which you pull on to make the fingers move. This was actually very challenging for us, but once we figured it out we had fun.

            This week our unit was on Bioengineering. Our assignment was to create a rocket out of a 2 liter bottle. First we created a CAD of our design. We originally had the tip of the rocket round, but when we were creating the rocket we decided to make it a cone (it was easier). Caitlin had the idea to stuff some crumpled paper in the cone before we glued it on, to make the cone sturdier. I don't think it did anything. We also glued a pencil on the side so that the rocket would glide straight (although it didn't). Today we all went outside to test our rockets. We filled our rocket with about a half cup of water. It didn't go straight; it went around in a loop and then hit the ground. I was expecting it to do better, but it could have done worse. Maybe using a sturdier material for the tip of the rocket would have worked better? Or maybe bigger fins. Although I think that the lighter the rocket weighs, the higher and farther it will go (that's my guess).

            This week our unit was Environmental engineering, and we learned about the wastewater treatment process. Today we had to make a water purifier out of a plastic bottle cut in half, cotton balls, sand, and rocks. For the first try (picture on the left), Caitlin and I put cotton balls at the bottom, then sand, then small pebbles, and lastly large pebbles. It worked pretty well- the water was clear but yellowish. The second try (video on the right), we added more sand and put less rocks. It worked a litle bit better, the water slightly less yellow. We tried it a third time, and we added a few more cotton balls. This really didn't work- the water was cloudy and brown. I don't know why. I think if we had washed off the rocks before putting them in the bottle, the water would have come out clearer.

            This week we started our Electrical engineering unit. We learned about the units of electricity and Ohm's law. We also learned about circuits. We had to do two CADs- breadboarding and parallel v. series. It was very confusing.

            Today we worked on our labs. We had to make a bunch of different circuits. We used an arduino unit for them and wrote a bunch of different codes for the LEDs- flashing, blinking all at once, blinking in a pattern, etc. It was very tricky, but luckily Caitlin is very smart so we were able to do all of them! It was very exciting when they worked.

            Our unit has been Business engineering, and our assignment was to come up with a pitch (like they do on shark tank). Caitlin and I had a hard time coming up with an idea, but we ended up doing improved heated slippers (my mom is always cold, that's what gave me the idea). We did some research and found out that all the heated slippers that exist plug into the wall so you can't walk around in them. They are also very hideous and expensive. We decided to pitch battery operated heated slippers that are affordable and fashionable. We had to make a slideshow about our pitch and go over SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats), and we presented to the class today.

            Our recent assignment has been to make a bridge out of 40 pieces of spaghetti. The bridge had to hold a bucket of water. Caitlin, Catherine and I had to do two iterations. Our first design was to break each piece of spaghetti into 3 pieces, then glue them all together by staggering them (it is hard to explain.) We basically just glued the spaghetti together in rows of 3, then glued each row together so we had a flat bridge. Then we added some pieces on top in criss crosses to hold it together. This design actually worked out pretty well, but it snapped on both sides of the bridge (which was weird.) Our second design was pretty much the same, but we doubled up the spaghetti. We did rows of three, but two layers. We added more pieces on top again. We thought that the bridge would break immediately, but it actually worked out great! It held 1263 grams of water before breaking! Out of all the bridges in the class, we got second place (scores were calculated by dividing amount of water held by the weight of the bridge.) 
            
            <ol type="1">
  <li> The weight of our first bridge was 30.9 g, and the second bridge was 29.6 g.</li>
  <li> The amount of water held by our first bridge was 525.3 g. Our second bridge held 1263 g. </li>
 <li> The glue was the heaviest part of our bridge. Making sure that the pieces didn't break required a bit of extra glue.</li>
  <li> We came up with our design by thinking that we wouldn't waste any spaghetti pieces by doing sides for the bridge, and we figured staggering pieces would make the brige stronger. </li>
  <li> The design worked better than we expected. The second time it held a lot more than we thought it would, and we ended up getting the second highest score in the class.  </li>
 <li> The bridge snapped at the sides both times. We thought that the weakest point would be the middle.</li>
  <li> We could make our bridge thicker. This would probably prolong the points of failure. </li>

            Now that it is second semester, we have longer and more complicated projects. We were given two options for this project: to make a car out of a mousetrap, or to make an arduino car. Caitlin, Catherine and I decided on the arduino car (the more challenging project). An arduino unit is a mini computer, so this project requires electrical engineering and coding. So far, we have written a project propasal, made a sketch of our design, made a CAD of it, and also made a CAD of the breadboard. For our project proposal, we had to write a project description, do project research, consider design constraints, make a bill of materials, make a schedule, and write team member biographies. For our sketches and CADs, we had to measure everything so that our designs made sense.

            We have been working on our arduino car for the past few weeks. We started off with figuring out where to put the wires on the breadboard. We watched a bunch of Youtube videos and finally figured it out. We then had to solder some of the wires to the motor (that was my favorite part!) I had to redo it a million times because they kept falling off but it's ok, it finally worked. We attached the motors to the base of a car (a piece of cardboard). We used duct tape and zip ties for that (Caitlin's idea). Since we only were able to use 2 wheels with motors, we had to diy some front wheels. Caitlin and I spent forever doing that. She even brought in orange juice bottle caps, but those didn't work. We ended up cutting out 2 cardboard circles, poking a hole in the middle, sticking a skewer in the middle, then putting the skewer through a straw, and gluing the straw to the bottom of the car. Catherine decided to put led lights on the car, so that it could have turning signals! Doing that also took forever.

            We had finally finished the car, and it was working great, but then on the day we were supposed to test our car, the wheels stopped turning. We couldn't figure out why. The next week, we fixed it... I think it was the battery that had died (even though it was brand new)? I'm not entirely sure. But anyways, today we got it to work again, so we took it outside to test it. For the most part it works, although the wheels sometimes get stuck and you have to give it a little push. The other groups that did arduino cars got motion sensors. We didn't get one (there weren't enough). So, our car kept running into stuff... but other than that it worked great! This was a very difficult project but it was a lot of fun!

  Today we did a challenge. In our groups, we had to determine whether there are more doors or wheels at CV. We had to estimate and come up with calculations to prove our argument. Caitlin, Catherine and I concluded that there are more doors than wheels. We started by doing calculations for doors. Since there are 108 teachers here, and they probably all have one classroom that has 2 doors, that's 216 doors. Each teacher probably parks a car here, and each car has 5 doors (includes trunk), so 540 car doors. Since the science rooms all have cabinets (those count as doors), we figured there are about 20 science rooms with 25 cabinets in them, that is 500 more doors. We also figured that since there are 2,700 students here, there are about 2,800 lockers (that includes the lockers in the locker rooms). We also think that there are about 1,356 bathroom doors (the stalls). We added an extra 200 doors for administration car and rooms. All of that adds up to 4,356 doors total.  
            </p>  
            <p>
  For the wheels, we started by calculating the amount of wheels on rolling chairs. Now that I look back, we probably should have factored in teacher chairs, because I think they are all rolling chairs... oh well. In the computer science classroom, we calculated 300 wheels on student chairs. We know that most classes don't have rolling chairs, so we guessed about 6 classrooms have rolling chairs, so that's 180 rolling chairs. The student chairs each have 10 wheels, so we multiplied 180 by 10, so 1,800 wheels. We calculated 604 wheels from staff and administration cars/vehicles. That is a total of 2,834 wheels. Therefore, there are 1,552 more doors than wheels here at CV. We spent the rest of class starting our new project- and egg drop.
