            <i>8/25/23</i> - Today we went over the rules and proceedures for this class, as well as the engineering process. Afterwards, we went outside to do a challenge. The class split into two groups, and each group had eight pipes and one marble. The goal was to hold the pipes in a line and get the marble to roll all the way through the pipes into a bucket placed at the end. Each person in the group had to hold a pipe once, which was challenging.

            <i>9/4/23</i> - This week we started designing our Rube Goldberg Machines. We created our CAD and then began making the pieces.

          <i>9/18/23</i> - Today we finished creating our Rube Goldberg Machine. After a lot of trial and error, we finally got it to work. The main thing we changed from our original design was the cardboard flap with the needle (right next to the balloon). Instead of doing that, we attached the needle to the car and got rid of the carboard flap. We had some trouble with the pulley at first. We attached the baseball to one end of the string, and an eraser to the other end, which worked. How our machine works is you let go of the pulley with baseball. The baseball hits the lever, making the car with the needle roll down the inclined plane and pop the balloon.

            <i>9/27/23</i> - Earlier this week, we learned about parts of a computer. Today, we disected a computer. It was surprisingly difficult, but we managed to disassemble and reassemble it successfully.

                - Today our assignment was to make a prosthetic hand, since our new unit is on bioengineering. We were given cardboard, duct tape, and string. Caitlin and I traced my hand but then made the fingers bigger (for better grip). We ended up taping the middle and ring finger together. We taped the string to the three big fingers. Caitlin used the rubber band to keep all the strings down, which at one point ripped off the "thumb" (that was kind of funny) but we fixed it. The three strings connect to one string at the "wrist", which you pull on to make the fingers move. This was actually very challenging for us for some reason but once we figured it out we had fun.
