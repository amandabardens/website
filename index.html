            <i>8/25/23</i> - Today we went over the rules and proceedures for this class, as well as the engineering process. Afterwards, we went outside to do a challenge. The class split into two groups, and each group had eight pipes and one marble. The goal was to hold the pipes in a line and get the marble to roll all the way through the pipes into a bucket placed at the end. Each person in the group had to hold a pipe once, which was challenging.
