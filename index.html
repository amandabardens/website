            <i>8/25/23</i> - Today we went over the rules and proceedures for this class, as well as the engineering process. Afterwards, we went outside to do a challenge. The class split into two groups, and each group had eight pipes and one marble. The goal was to hold the pipes in a line and get the marble to roll all the way through the pipes into a bucket placed at the end. Each person in the group had to hold a pipe once, which was challenging.

          <i>9/18/23</i> - Today we finished creating our Rube Goldberg Machine. After a lot of trial and error, we finally got it to work. The main thing we changed from our original design was the cardboard flap with the needle (right next to the balloon). Instead of doing that, we attached the needle to the car and got rid of the carboard flap. We had some trouble with the pulley at first. We attached the baseball to one end of the string, and an eraser to the other end, which worked. How our machine works is you let go of the pulley with baseball. The baseball hits the lever, making the car with the needle roll down the inclined plane and pop the balloon.
