            Today we went over the rules and proceedures for this class, as well as the engineering process. Afterwards, we went outside to do a challenge. The class split into two groups, and each group had eight pipes and one marble. The goal was to hold the pipes in a line and get the marble to roll all the way through the pipes into a bucket placed at the end. Each person in the group had to hold a pipe once, which was challenging.

            This week we started designing our Rube Goldberg Machines. We created our CAD and then began making the pieces.

        Today we finished creating our Rube Goldberg Machine. After a lot of trial and error, we finally got it to work. The main thing we changed from our original design was the cardboard flap with the needle (right next to the balloon). Instead of doing that, we attached the needle to the car and got rid of the carboard flap. We had some trouble with the pulley at first. We attached the baseball to one end of the string, and an eraser to the other end, which worked. How our machine works is you let go of the pulley with baseball. The baseball hits the lever, making the car with the needle roll down the inclined plane and pop the balloon.

            This week our unit was on Computer Engineering, so we learned about parts of a computer. Today, we disected a computer. Mr. Kim gave us the google slides with the instructions, and we had to disassemble and reassemble it. It was surprisingly difficult, but we managed to do it successfully.

            Today our assignment was to make a prosthetic hand, since our new unit is on bioengineering. We were given cardboard, duct tape, and string. Caitlin and I traced my hand but then made the fingers bigger (for better grip). We ended up taping the middle and ring finger together. We taped the string to the three big fingers. Caitlin used the rubber band to keep all the strings down, which at one point ripped off the "thumb" (that was kind of funny) but we fixed it. I don't think that the thumb really helped, although maybe it provided a little bit of support. The three strings connect to one string at the "wrist", which you pull on to make the fingers move. This was actually very challenging for us, but once we figured it out we had fun.

            This week our unit was on Bioengineering. Our assignment was to create a rocket out of a 2 liter bottle. First we created a CAD of our design. We originally had the tip of the rocket round, but when we were creating the rocket we decided to make it a cone (it was easier). Caitlin had the idea to stuff some crumpled paper in the cone before we glued it on, to make the cone sturdier. I don't think it did anything. We also glued a pencil on the side so that the rocket would glide straight (although it didn't). Today we all went outside to test our rockets. We filled our rocket with about a half cup of water. It didn't go straight; it went around in a loop and then hit the ground. I was expecting it to do better, but it could have done worse. Maybe using a sturdier material for the tip of the rocket would have worked better? Or maybe bigger fins. Although I think that the lighter the rocket weighs, the higher and farther it will go (that's my guess).

            This week our unit was Environmental engineering, and we learned about the wastewater treatment process. Today we had to make a water purifier out of a plastic bottle cut in half, cotton balls, sand, and rocks. For the first try (picture on the left), Caitlin and I put cotton balls at the bottom, then sand, then small pebbles, and lastly large pebbles. It worked pretty well- the water was clear but yellowish. The second try (video on the right), we added more sand and put less rocks. It worked a litle bit better, the water slightly less yellow. We tried it a third time, and we added a few more cotton balls. This really didn't work- the water was cloudy and brown. I don't know why. I think if we had washed off the rocks before putting them in the bottle, the water would have come out clearer.

            This week we started our Electrical engineering unit. We learned about the units of electricity and Ohm's law. We also learned about circuits. We had to do two CADs- breadboarding and parallel v. series. It was very confusing.
